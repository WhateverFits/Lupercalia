# Lupercalia

Inspired by the [LoveBox](https://frightanic.com/iot/the-lovebox-a-gift-from-a-maker/) and a Roman festival. This version uses MQTT for the messaging and a 3D printed box since I didn't have access to my wood workshop.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Arduino, basic soldering skills, ESP8266.

## Deployment

Supports OTA updates. Once you get an OTA capable image flashed, the rest is easy! I custom built a little ruby cgi that serves up an appropriate file for each of your OTA devices.

## Box building

3D print the following three objects (two parts on the box)
